            <p>I love learning languages. Ever since I was introduced to french as a child in school, and shown the wonders of other cultures. For me learning a new language isn't just a way to communicate with people - it's a way to gain a new perspective on the world, see new ways of thinking, and experience the same thing through a new lense. It's also really fun to be able to surprise someone when I can speak their language and of course "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart." </p>
            <p>After learning french in school, and then moving onto spaish as well, I began to look at (~dabble in) many other langauges such as Japanese and Norwegian. After countless weeks of tireless research (youtube) I found my own method to not only continue with Spanish and French but to add Italian and then Portugese to my growing collection of (sort of) spoken romance languages. I decided to branch out to German (/Austrian) next for an upcoming trip. I learnt how to order a beer and after that maybe dropped off a little (but what more do you need let's be honest) but have since vowed to get back on the language train once and for all! I will gain greater understanding in all of these languages before I move on(maybe)!</p>
            <p>Just for fun, here's a picture of me in the Pyrenees about 2 weeks after finishing my exams - it was the first time I had truly been able to speak a language with native speakers in the country. I loved it and it gave me so much more determination and motoivation to keep learning. </p>
